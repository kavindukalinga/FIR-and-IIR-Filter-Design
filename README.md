# FIR-and-IIR-Filter-Design
The objective of this project is to provide experience in the design of FIR and IIR digital filters for prescribed specifications. For FIR filters, the windowing method (in conjunction with the Kaiser window) is used whereas, for IIR filters, the bilinear transformation method is used.
